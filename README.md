# Playwright Homework
A framework template to perform homework for the class "SDET with Playwright"

## Configuration
1. Create ```.env``` file in the root of the project. Use the ```.env-SAMPLE``` as an example
2. Update ```.env``` file with a valid Bondar Academy credentials
    Example:
    ```
    EMAIL='test@test.com'
    PASSWORD='Welcome1'
    ```
3. Open a new terminal, execute command ```npm install``` to install project dependencies
4. Run a sample test in ```homework.spec.ts``` to make sure everything is working

P.S. ```.env```file is added to ```.gitignore``` so it will not be version controlled. 
The stored credentials only be available for the local computer and will not be shared or exposed to repository.
